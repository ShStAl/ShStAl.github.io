            <h2>Why am I interested in coding?</h2>
            <p>I had programming course at the university, so I decided to continue my studies and have been taking
                Python courses for half a year now. Thanks to the experience of working as an IT-recruiter, I learned
                more about development languages and now I want to become a developer myself.</p>

            <h2>What about my experience?</h2>
            <p>I studied at St. Petersburg State University and completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in
                sociology. Before I started learning programming, I worked as a IT-recruiter in an agency and as a
                program manager in the travel industry.</p>

            <h2>What are my personal interests?</h2>
            <p>I love spending time with friends and traveling. I have already visited 30 countries and plan to visit
                the rest üòé. I can't imagine my life without music and sports. These two help me gather my thoughts and
                find energy for new achievements.</p>
